    "I created the sample data by driving around the track in both directions between 3-4 times each side. The driving was done with keyboard for speed/acceleration and with the mouse for steering, since I noticed in earlier tries with the keyboard, that the steering angles where not smooth but very spikey. With the mouse input a much clearer turning angle could be achieved for the steering angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recorded data consists out of the path to left, center and right images, the steering angle (label), as well as general information as throttle, break and speed. For the CNN training all images will be used, as NVIDIA featured in their approach. \n",
    "The final model will only use the center image to determine a steering angle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally the vehicle needs throttle to actually drive. The steering angle depends on the speed of the vehicle at the moment of steering. Higher speed results in a larger turning radius. The data was recorded at top speed (~30mph), so the correlation of speed/steering can be ignored. "
